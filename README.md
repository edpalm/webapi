## Data

* The user which catches the fish
* The position (longitude and latitude) of the catch
* Species of the fish
* Weight
* Length
* Image-url
* Timestamp of the catch

the API must have some kind of Authentication/Authorization. A user should be able to sign in through the API in a safe way.

## Requirements

* The API should at least support representations with application/json
* The API should try to follow the constraints for Restful APIs
* The API should embrace the idea of HATEOAS. The API should have one entry point and use HATEOAS for making the API browsable.
* The API should give the client possibilities to create, read, update and delete resources.
* Unsafe HTTP methods and data about users in the system should require authentication done through the API with implementation of JWT-tokens.
* The API should give some ability to register a web hook which will trigger on some, of you chosen, event.
* Postman collection that showcases api calls, DonÂ´t forget to make calls that shows your error handling like bad requests, bad credentials and so on.

# Report

##1. Explain and defend your implementation of HATEOAS in your solution.
##2. If your solution should implement multiple representations of the resources. How would you do it?
##3. Motivate and defend your authentication solution.
###. What other authentication solutions could you implement?
###. What pros/cons do this solution have?
##4. Explain how your web hook works.
##5. Since this is your first own web API there are probably things you would solve in an other way looking back at this assignment. Write your down thoughts 
##6. about this.
##7. Did you do something extra besides the fundamental requirements? Explain them.
